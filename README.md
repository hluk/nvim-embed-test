This is test application that uses embedding feature of [neovim](https://neovim.io/).

Requires Qt 5, PyQt5, neovim and Python client (Arch Linux packages "python-pyqt5", "neovim" and "python-neovim").

Execute using `./nvim-embed-test.py [FILE]` to edit content of `FILE` (not the file itself; `:w` command won't work).

Implements only minimal set of features for testing.
